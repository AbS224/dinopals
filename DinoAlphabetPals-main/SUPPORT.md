# Support Policy

> **⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: Lower priority - not actively maintained.**

This project is currently a lower priority as I'm focused on more pressing work in the regtech space. It's provided "as-is" with limited maintenance.

## What to Expect

- **No SLA**: We do not guarantee response times for issues or pull requests.
- **Lower Priority Status**: This project is not actively maintained as focus is on other work commitments.
- **Regular Monitoring**: The maintainer checks in regularly but may not respond to all inquiries.
- **Delayed or No Responses**: Issues and PRs may receive delayed responses or no response at all.
- **Security**: For vulnerabilities, use private advisories per `SECURITY.md`. Fixes are best-effort only.
- **Self-Help**: Feel free to fork, experiment, and adapt to your needs under the MIT License.
- **Contributions**: PRs are welcome and reviewed as time permits, but expect significant delays.

## Recommendations

- **For urgent needs**: Fork the repository and maintain your own version
- **For active development**: Create your own fork rather than waiting for reviews
- **For community support**: Use GitHub Discussions or Issues to help each other
- **For security concerns**: Follow the process in SECURITY.md, but expect best-effort response only

This project is functional and suitable for use, with maintenance as a lower priority due to other work commitments.
